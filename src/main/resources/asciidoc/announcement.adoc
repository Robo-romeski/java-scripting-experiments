Â© 2013 Farata Systems LLC.

Java ecosystem offers lots of different ways to architect, develop, and deploy a distributed Web application. The parallel ecosystem known as HTML5 offers lots of different ways to design, develop, and deploy the cross-platform UI that works on multiple Web browsers and variety of devices. This online training class has a goal to bring these two universes together.

The goal of this training is an immersion into an environment similar to a real-world enterprise setup. Be prepared to download, install and master lots of various software packages that will be used at different stages of training.

The title reads _Web Development_, and we'll spend about 40% of the time developing UI in HTML5 and about 60% of the time will be spend in the server-side. 

== Prerequisites 

Attendees should commit about 20 hour a week for studying and working on the assignments from this course. We'll split the class into small teams to work on the assignments during the week, so your contribution will be required. 

Attendees must have a working knowledge of core Java, and understanding of Java EE technologies.

Each attendee has to have a modern computer with plenty of disk space (4+ GB of RAM is recommended).

Having a decent Internet connection (more than 2Mbps) is a must.


== How

This will be a  a mix of theory (40%) and practical work (60%). During this training attendees will develop an online auction. This auction should look good and be functional on desktops, tablets and smartphones.

This training will consist of 10 weekly 3-hour online sessions on Sundays and 9 optional one-hour meetings in between.  We'll use screen-sharing software. Attendees will be able to hear and see the instructors and will communicate with them via a chat room. The first class will start on February 23rd, 2014 at 8AM New York time.
